# Install Kata Code

Kata Code runs coding agents on your computer and lets you control them from its
desktop, web, or mobile app. Set up the machine where the agents will work first.

## Requirements

Command-line use, SSH hosts, and WSL backends need Node.js 22.16+ (22.x), 23.11+
(23.x), or 24.10 and later. The native desktop app includes its server runtime.

You need an installed, authenticated provider before starting a thread. You can
launch Kata Code and configure providers afterwards.

## Run without installing

```bash
npx @kata-sh/code-cli@latest
```

This starts the server and opens the local web app. Run
`npx @kata-sh/code-cli@latest --help` for command-line options.

## Desktop app

Download a release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/gannonh/kata-code/releases),
or run `npx @kata-sh/code-cli@latest`. Kata native package-manager packages are not published.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Choose a WSL distro in **Settings → Connections** to run agents and projects
there. Install Node.js and provider CLIs inside that distro. Kata Code installs its
matching server runtime there automatically; the first launch after an app
update can take longer.

### Open a project from a terminal

With the desktop app already running on the same machine:

```bash
npx @kata-sh/code-cli app
```

This opens a new thread for the current directory, adding the project if needed.
Pass a path, such as `npx @kata-sh/code-cli app ../my-project`, to open another directory. It requires
the desktop app, so a standalone server or an SSH session is not enough. If the
command cannot reach the app, start or update the desktop app and try again.

## Providers

Open **Settings → Providers** in the web or desktop app, select the environment,
and enable the provider you want. Installation, login, and configuration belong
to that environment's machine, even when you connect from a phone or another
computer.

| Provider    | Install and authenticate                                                                     |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex       | Install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli), then run `codex login`.        |
| Claude      | Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), then run `claude auth login`. |
| Cursor      | Install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), then run `agent login`.                        |
| Grok Build  | Install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli), then run `grok login`.                           |
| OpenCode    | Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then run `opencode auth login`.                     |
| Antigravity | Install and sign in with Google from Kata Code's provider settings.                          |

Provider CLIs must be on the server's `PATH`. If Kata Code cannot find one, set its
**Binary path** in provider settings, especially when using a version manager.
Cursor's executable is `cursor-agent`, although its login command is
`agent login`. Antigravity can use its managed runtime without a `PATH` entry.

When a provider CLI is behind its latest release, its provider card shows the
available version. **Update now** appears only when Kata Code can tell which
installer owns the CLI (its own update command, Homebrew, or a global npm, pnpm,
bun, or Vite+ install) and runs that installer. Otherwise update the CLI the same
way you installed it. Homebrew installs compare against the version Homebrew
offers, which can trail the npm release by a few hours.

Add another provider instance for a separate account or configuration. Each
instance can have its own environment variables, such as API keys or a custom
base URL. Mark secret values as sensitive; after saving, Kata Code does not display
their original values.

For provider-specific setup and accounts, see [Codex](./providers-codex.md),
[Claude](./providers-claude.md), [OpenCode](./providers-opencode.md), and
[Antigravity](./providers-antigravity.md).

## Next steps

- [Working with threads](./thread-sidebar.md): start tasks and organize parallel work.
- [Permission modes](./permission-modes.md): choose when agents ask before acting.
- [Remote access](./remote-access.md): connect from another device.
- [Running in the background](./background-service.md): keep a Linux or macOS host available.
- [Updating Kata Code](./updating.md): update the app and connected servers.
